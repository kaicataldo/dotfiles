# dotfiles

My dotfiles repo! This is (as always) a work in progress.

## Install/Update
`bin/setup.sh` clones and updates the submodules from their respective repos and then creates symlinks in the user's home directory to the files in this repository.

*__Warning__: this will overwrite any current files of the same name in your home directory.*
