# dotfiles

Here are my dotfiles. Feel free to use, fork, and modify them!

## Installation/Update

`bootstrap.sh` clones and updates the included submodules from their respective repos and then creates symlinks in the user's home directory to the files in this repository.

*__Warning__: this will overwrite any current files of the same name in your home directory.*

## Dependencies

Some other dependencies to install:
- [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew)
- [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
