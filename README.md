# dotfiles

My dotfiles repo! This is (as always) a work in progress.

## Install/Update
`bin/install.sh` `git pull`'s from this repo, `git update`'s the submodules from their respective repos, and then creates symlinks in the user's home directory to the files in this repository.

*__Warning__: this will overwrite any current files of the same name in your home directory.*
