# dotfiles

As someone who enjoys tinkering and improving workflows and tooling, playing around with my local dotfiles setup is something I do often and with great enthusiasm! Having a dotfiles repository has allowed me to document my changes, share my learnings, sync my setup across multiple machines, and quickly become productive on a new machine. This repository gets changed often!

## Installation/Update
`bin/bootstrap` clones and updates the submodules from their respective repos and then creates symlinks in the user's home directory to the files in this repository.

*__Warning__: this will overwrite any current files of the same name in your home directory.*
